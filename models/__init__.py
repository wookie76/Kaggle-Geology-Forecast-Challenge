"""
Models Package for the Geology Forecast Challenge.

This package contains modules related to:
- Stage 1 ensemble models (XGBoost, RandomForest)
- Stage 2 GRU refiner model
"""

# You can selectively import key classes or functions here to make them
# available at the package level, e.g.:
# from .stage1_ensemble import optimize_hyperparameters, train_ensemble_models_for_fold
# from .gru_refiner import build_deterministic_gru_refiner

# For now, we'll keep it simple and users will import from specific modules:
# e.g., from models import stage1_ensemble
#       from models import gru_refiner
